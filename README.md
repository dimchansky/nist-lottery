# NIST Lottery

Conduct fair and transparent lotteries using cryptographically secure random values from the NIST Randomness Beacon.

## About

The **NIST Lottery** is a web-based tool that allows you to calculate lottery winners in a secure and verifiable manner. By utilizing random values provided by the [NIST Randomness Beacon](https://beacon.nist.gov/home), this tool ensures that lottery results are unbiased and cannot be manipulated.

## Features

- **Fair and Transparent:** Leverages publicly available random numbers generated by NIST.
- **Secure:** Uses cryptographically secure random values.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple interface for selecting draw date, time, and number of participants.
- **Verifiable:** Provides calculation details and code examples for independent verification.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Future Date and Time (UTC):** Choose a date and time in the future for the lottery draw.

2. **Record Participants:** Assign each participant a unique number prior to the draw.

3. **Announce the Draw Details:** Share the draw date, time, and participant list with all participants.

4. **Determine the Winner:**

    - After the draw time has passed, visit the [NIST Lottery tool](https://dimchansky.github.io/nist-lottery/).
    - Enter the draw date, time, and total number of participants.
    - The tool fetches the random value from the NIST Randomness Beacon and calculates the winning number.

## Usage

### Access the Tool

Visit the NIST Lottery tool at: [https://dimchansky.github.io/nist-lottery/](https://dimchansky.github.io/nist-lottery/)

### Steps

    - **Number of Participants:** Enter the total number of participants in the lottery.

2. **Calculate Winner:**

    - Click on the **Calculate Winner** button.
    - The tool will fetch the random value from NIST and display the winning number.
